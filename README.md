## Final Excersice for Introduction to Python

A simple Python script that categorizes a list of famous people into three groups:
- Magicians
- Scientists
- Others

It goes through a list of names and adds them to their categories. If they happen to be a magician, they get added a pre-string: "El gran "
through the method `def hacer_grandioso():`, after that, it shows in the console the list of names, their categories, and changes to the magicians.
